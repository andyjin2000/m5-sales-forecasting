# Estimate the Unit Sales of Walmart Retail Goods
Sales forecasting is important for businesses to gauge their product demand so that they can plan to restock appropriately in advance depending on their estimated future sales. We focus on the dataset provided by Kaggle for the M5 sales forecasting competition. In order to compute accurate predictions for product sales 28 days in advance, we experiment with various statistical techniques and deep learning models to find an optimal approach for this problem. Overall, our results show that LGBM, exponential smoothing, and the N-BEATS model are the most promising approaches for this challenge.
